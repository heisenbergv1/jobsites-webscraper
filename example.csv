As our founding iOS engineer, you will help us launch our iOS SDK. Functionally, the SDK would be similar to the React SDK. It would offer our notification inbox to iOS developers. However, we'd like for you to optimize the UI/UX for a pleasant iOS experience. Like the React SDK, we want to support extensive customization, well-designed components, and even a lite-SDK to offer only the network layer. We'd love to optimize everything from supported gestures to animations for a best-in-class mobile experience. You will also be responsible for crafting the documentation and user guides and working with the early customers to help them integrate the SDK into their products.
As we grow, the opportunity to manage a team of mobile developers will surface. However, if you'd rather be a high-performing individual contributor, that's fine with us too.
Responsibilities

Defining the functional and technical spec of the application in close collaboration with the product team and our customers.
Working with the product manager to scope out stories and sprints.
Implement the functionality along with unit and integration tests. Setup builds using a CI system (We use CircleCI, but you can pick something else for mobile).
Hire, attract, and onboard other great engineers. You can help by referring candidates, writing blog posts about the technical challenges, and delivering tech talks at meetups and conferences. We are happy to cover any costs incurred.
Shape the culture of our company to create the next Stripe, Twilio, or your favorite company.
Be our developer evangelist: Our go-to-market strategy involves bottom-up developer adoption. Therefore, our entire team is an evangelist for our product - all of us write blog posts sharing what we have learned, and we talk to our users directly. (We have some of our biggest customers on a shared Slack workspace) 


We love building with our own API. In the past, we have built some fun little hacks to get developer attention, like our Hacker News Chrome extension and Firefox add-on. We plan to build more of these as we grow, so hit us up if you have any ideas!

 


Requirements
These requirements have been selected to make sure you'd be successful at the job. Please read them carefully:

4+ years of experience working on iOS with Swift. Experience in shipping SDKs is a major plus.
Experience writing test-driven code with an understanding of integration testing. We require a minimum of two years of test-driven development experience.
Willingness to go above and beyond. For example, keeping track of new security vulnerabilities that might impact us or fixing customer issues proactively and notifying them.
Enjoy taking on challenging responsibilities. (We are a startup, after all!) This includes maintaining our uptime and finding creative ways to help customers achieve their goals.
Good writing ability as demonstrated by documentation, README, or blog posts you have written.
Excellent communication skills in English. This helps immensely as a remote team.

Nice-to-Have

An ability to ship an MVP quickly so we can attract feedback early.
An eye for UX and an understanding of the iOS design patterns.
A good understanding of software architecture & object-oriented design patterns (like SOLID).
A desire to start your own startup either now or in the future. Startups are hard, and this aspiration will help you appreciate the challenges in the job. You'll get hands-on learning of what building an early-stage startup is like. As a bonus, the founders are prolific angel investors and eager to invest in the startups of our alumni.

Interesting Challenges
As our founding mobile engineer, you will get to own this product end-to-end. This will naturally present many challenges to you. Here are some that we foresee:

Performant state management across multiple devices with real-time synchronization.
Building robust logging and analytics to help our customers understand the flow of their notifications.
Engineering reliability and performance so we can scale up with our customers.
Improving the UX/DX as you build new features or improve existing ones. Keeping new releases backward compatible for as long as we can.

A big reason why we love working on MagicBell is that we get to build for other developers. You'll get to work with some of the brightest engineers (our customers) to help them build notifications faster than they ever imagined. We routinely chat with them on our Slack Community (join us there!).
The Offer
We pay well and offer meaningful equity (every full-time employee has equity). We can't match Google/Facebook in their perks, but we make sure you have everything you need to do the best work you have done in your career.
Location: Fully remote
Salary: $120k - $170k (or more if you have a lot more experience than our requirements)

Equity: 0.50% - 1.00% with standard 4-year vesting and an extended 10-year exercise window after 2 years in service. Read why this matters.
Hours: Up to 40 hrs/week. While we don't overwork routinely, as a startup, there are times when you need to work beyond your regular work hours or fix something on the weekend. If that is a strict no for you, we suggest not applying.
Flexible work: We require the EST 10 am to 1 pm overlap, and the rest of the time is up to you to manage. Few meetings, mostly asynchronous communication, and other day-to-day details on our blog.
Time off: 30 working days a year (20 PTO and 10 public holidays. You are welcome to take sick days as you need them).
Benefits: Healthcare (with Dental & Vision in the US), paid time off, and an annual all-expense-paid retreat somewhere beautiful. $1k/yr to attend any conferences/events that you find useful.
WFH Support: $5k for computer, standing desk, mic, or anything else you need. Up to $300/mo for a co-working desk. If you need anything else, please ask.

If you read the entire job description, please list out which of the nice-to-haves you possess in the last question of the form.", "WORLDWIDE", "N/A", "Dec 30", "🌏 WORLDWIDE

Orchest started out as an open source project with the goal of making technical complexities that data scientists have to deal with disappear. We have grown into a company to empower data teams across the world through better data science tools.

To continue our fast-paced growth, we are building a world-class fully-distributed engineering team. You'll help us get there by owning the frontend of the Orchest product, supporting our users, and ultimately playing a key role in the growth of Orchest.


What you'll do

Orchest consists of an advanced client side application built in TypeScript and React. In addition, it features a micro services style Python based backend to which the browser client connects. We expect you to bring your skill set and experience to further develop the product by owning the full client side experience.

More specifically, in this role you will:

Develop the Orchest core product, which involves many interesting problems, both technical (e.g. 'implementing our drag and drop system in a performant way') and conceptual (e.g. 'how do users expect this feature to work?')
Develop the Orchest Cloud offering to, among other things, make sure users have a smooth onboarding experience
Debug customer problems and build features to solve them
Shape and build the Orchest product, culture and company

We often make product decisions based on customer feedback, so you’ll have the opportunity to build something that solves real customer needs. You’ll also weigh in on our product roadmap as an end-user yourself (we love dogfooding Orchest whenever we can!).
What we look for

5+ years experience in professional software development, ideally some of which you’ve spent in startups
TypeScript and React expertise
Ability to make technical decisions quickly
GNU/Linux or macOS working experience
A getting-things-done mindset and the motivation to keep improving
Being able to keep up with the pace, we work quickly!

What gives you an edge

Experience in Python
Experience with container technologies like Docker
Experience with open source
Not shying away from taking on additional responsibilities
Data science familiarity (reasoning how product changes will impact our end users)

Reviewable is growing quickly and we're looking for an experienced Product Designer to help us continue to delight developers around the world.
Reviewable is a code review tool for GitHub pull requests that makes the process of serious reviews thorough yet efficient. It's not for everyone but the teams that need it swear by it. However, as Reviewable has grown organically over the years its design hasn't kept pace, and the most common complaint from potential users today is that the UI looks confusing and the workflow feels foreign. That's where you come in!
Responsibilities:
Propose and design changes and new features, working closely with developers and informed by user feedback.
Revamp the onboarding flow and keep it and the documentation up to date as the tool evolves.
Over time, overhaul Reviewable's core design to better align with user expectations, without losing the magic that made it popular in the first place.
Update the app's visual design and ensure it works well across all devices.
Contribute to other areas (e.g., marketing, development, customer support) as your skills and inclinations allow.
As the sole designer on the team, you'll get to do it all.
You might be a fit if:
You have significant experience as a product designer.
You have experience working on developer tools, or as a developer.
You can strike a good balance between finding the perfect solution and shipping something fast.
You're confident crafting HTML and CSS and comfortable with Git version control.

Reviewable is a very small bootstrapped company that was run solely by its founder for many years. This is not a VC-backed rocket ship, but we are growing steadily and expanding our team as we do so. Even though we're small we offer the usual benefits: health insurance, 401K, flexible hours, unlimited vacation time, etc. We're remote work natives, but we hope to supplement that with occasional in-person gatherings as the pandemic recedes. We move fast, unencumbered by committees or office politics; everyone reports directly to the CEO/founder.
Please get in touch if you find the challenge of designing developer tools intriguing and aren't afraid of leading the charge. You'll have an outsized impact on the product and ultimately help bend the company's trajectory upward!", "USA-ONLY", "N/A", "Dec 30", "🇺🇸 USA-ONLY

This is a safe space for kids to get their imaginations fired up, bodies moving, and social skills sharpened instead of turning into screen zombies and video game addicts. We are using technology to enable kids to engage directly with each other and our beloved cast of Supernow characters (imagine watching Sesame Street but engaging directly with Elmo!) and join teams to drive the storylines themselves in choose-your-own-adventure style classes. Our characters are played by multi-talented creatives who we work with to co-create their one-of-a-kind classes and bring them to life on our platform.We’re building the next irresistible kids brand that every family in America will know and love and we’re growing FAST. With top investors behind us including First Round Capital and Slow Ventures, and a small but mighty core team, we’re ready to make that a reality.That’s where you come in.

We're used by over 3 million people on a monthly basis, and we're looking for Senior Full Stack Engineers with advanced TypeScript skills, who can help us build the next iteration of CodeSandbox that will allow you to run any kind of project from anywhere.
As Senior Full Stack Engineer you'll have the opportunity to design and work on the next-generation collaborative IDE we're building. You'll be part of various key projects that will highly impact the experience of hundreds of thousands of CodeSandbox users.
You have worked at scale before and are used to designing and documenting architecture in a product-driven team environment. Communication in this role is key, as you'll be scoping and convincing your colleagues of key design choices. It's not the first time you have built frameworks, apps, or services from scratch. In this role some of our core values are key and we are curious about how you:
Collaborate closely with other engineers and designers.
Empower yourself and others by enabling them to learn from you.

Job requirements

Location: Anywhere -4 to +3 UTC (currently Daylight Savings, otherwise -5 to +2 UTC). That's anywhere between US and EU Eastern Time.
Full-time: At CodeSandbox this means 40 flexible hours Mon through Fri.
As a Senior Full Stack Engineer, you'll...
Design and architect the systems used for interfacing between CodeSandbox client and the underlying container running the end-user code.
Develop a binary WebSocket protocol for CodeSandbox's collaborative and real-time sharing features.
Design for a delightful user experience, finding ways to introduce optimistic UI patterns and network resilience using operational transformation (OT) and conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs).
Develop and maintain open source libraries to allow our community to build CodeSandbox integrations and plugins for editors and IDEs.
Build and maintain functional, contract, performance, and load-testing test suites to instill confidence in the code we ship to production.
Build and maintain performance-critical or safety-critical tools and services in lower-level languages, like Rust.
That said, these role responsibilities are just the start! At CodeSandbox, we encourage you to pursue wherever your interests take you. You'll have a chance to shape your role accordingly.

About you
You'll thrive as a Senior Full Stack Engineer if you:
Are a senior who leads by example, are a strong spoken and written communicator, and you empower those around you to do the best work they can.
Are a 'T-shaped' generalist developer. You have your areas of expertise, but aren't afraid to contribute to any part of the technology stack.
Are comfortable building and using advanced TypeScript features and patterns: Generics, Utility Types, Type Guards, Mixins, and Decorators are all tools of the trade.
Have experience identifying and isolating performance bottlenecks in a system, making good use of structured logging, tracing, instrumentation, and monitoring tools.
Have strong proficiency with React, its state-management systems, and have a good understanding of its reconciliation system.
Ideally, you care about user experience and have a strong interest in product and infrastructure design.
If you don’t meet 100% of the above qualifications, you should still consider applying. Studies show that you can still be considered for a role if you meet just 50% of the role’s requirements.

About us
At CodeSandbox we work from the idea that software development should be more accessible and collaborative. It should be possible for anyone to create an application if they have a great idea, and there should be no hassle in sharing this with others. We follow this mentality not only in how we build our product, but also in how we work with each other.
Whenever we start a new project, we include everyone on the team to help out. We expect everyone to be open to helping each other and generally encourage everyone to work together.
At CodeSandbox, we're offering:
A friendly, remote-first working environment.
Competitive salary & equity.

The successful candidate should have a passion for data engineering and the ability to innovate - there will be no instructions booklet, it's up to you and the team to develop a new cutting edge application from scratch while following software engineering best practice. However, above all else, you should enjoy working independently in a startup environment with all the pros and cons that that entails. You would be filling a key senior role in our young team which we think requires at least 4-5 years of hands on data engineering experience but we are known to have made exceptions if we really like someone :)

RESPONSIBILITIES
Your job responsibilities would include ...
Development, automation and scaling of our data pipeline
Implement established best practice where appropriate, innovate where not
Identify, design and implement process improvements (i.e. automate manual processes, re-design infrastructure, etc)
Mentor junior data engineers

ABOUT US

Tribes.AI is a new startup aiming to help build strong high-performance teams with advanced analytics.
Teams today produce a huge amount of data via everyday activities (emails, meetings, chats, files, tasks, code, etc) that can be mined for trends. This data provides powerful insights into team performance and helps management make more informed decisions about their employees, teams, and clients.
The management team at Tribes.AI has already successfully built and sold a large data consulting company, Datalicious. As a result, we understand how valuable our team members are, and how to build working teams that produce results no matter what timezone you are in. We value skilled employees who are at the top of their game, who want to take ownership, and who want to grow with us.
If you want to research us some more, we suggest you check out our current team on LinkedIn, what they say on Glassdoor, and our funding progress on Crunchbase.

OUR PERKS
All team members are offered the following perks ...
Flexible working hours (i.e. we don't care when you work, within reason, as long as the work gets done)
Working from home (i.e. we don't care from where you work, whatever makes you most productive)
Working from home expenses (i.e. we pay for your home Internet and any other reasonable expenses)
New laptop via EMI purchase (i.e. you buy it and own it but you can expense the monthly repayments)
Unlimited leave (i.e. we don't count days off so take as many as you need as long as the work gets done)
Training courses (i.e. we want you to keep learning so we pay for relevant courses and give you time off)
Share options plan (i.e. once you're past probation you will get access to our employee share options plan)
Opportunity to fast track your career with our highly motivated team

TECHNICAL SKILLS
To be successful, you would need the following skills ...
Excellent problem-solving skills are a must-have
Solid hands-on experience with Apache Airflow is a must-have
Experience developing and maintaining distributed system is another must-have 
Solid understanding of software engineering standards, methods and design principles is a must-have
Hands-on experience with Google Kubernetes would be a big plus
Familiarity with Google Cloud Platform tools in general is a bonus
Experience with graph databases such as Neo4j would be nice
Understanding of GraphQL APIs would also be helpful along the line

SOFT SKILLS
All our team members should be ...
Capable of working with almost no supervision (i.e. be self-driven, able to organize their own tasks, QA their own work and spot their own errors, explore new approaches, manage time frames/deadlines, etc)
Great written and spoken communicators (i.e. solid written and spoken English skills, efficiently use of instant messaging and other remote team platforms, ability to document code/tasks, know when to bother other people with their own problems, etc)
Team workers with a strong collaborative attitude (i.e. interest in other team member's challenges, ready to help with constructive suggestions unasked, never make any fuss about other people's mistakes, positive can-do attitude all around, etc)
Obsessed with perfection and driven by a constant need to optimize (i.e. always wanting to look for a way of doing things even better than they already are, etc)
Hungry for knowledge and passionate about their chosen discipline in the right way (i.e. not merely applying the most fancy algorithms or tools but instead the ones best suited to solve the business problem at hand)
Committed as in ready to stay with us for the long run (i.e. recruitment, on-boarding, and training are extremely time-consuming tasks we do not want to go through time and time again)
Please do NOT apply if ...
You do not know how to write optimized code efficiently (i.e. fast)
You do not have experience managing infrastructure to support pipelines 
You do not feel comfortable working for a startup 
You do not believe in what Tribes.AI is doing", "WORLDWIDE", "N/A", "Dec 30", "🌏 WORLDWIDE

We like to keep meetings and policies to a minimum, and expect team members to manage their own time and communications. We have one mandatory weekly meeting, structured as an informal code walk-through and review; this helps keep everyone aware of what the rest of the team is up to and how everything fits together. Day-to-day discussions, reviews, etc. are mostly on Discord and GitLab/GitHub.Compensation:Salary depends on your experience and level of seniority, and, of course, weekly hours.How to reach us:Please send resumes to [email protected].

We have a commitment to transparency and offer a 'no surprises experience' throughout the interview and hiring process. We value candor...as evidenced by the length of this job description. :)
Speaking of job descriptions, we don't let HR people write ours. They are written by software devs for software devs.
Our CEO prefers the title CED, Chief Executive Developer. Engineering and operational concerns don't take a back seat when potential sales come to the front door.
We practice and preach sound development practices. You are likely to learn and grow as a developer while working here.
We aren't trying to compete with FAANG compensation. But outside that bubble, we are competitive. See below for specifics on salary and benefits.
You will be working remote with a team that is all working remote and has been for years. Let's make the best use of our time by not commuting.
We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.
We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don't get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are designed so that you actually use them.

A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.
You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.
You are committed to automated testing of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).
You recognize that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the day-to-day realities of programming.
You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed
If you apply, we guarantee that we will give you a response, whether 'yay' or 'nay'. No black holes here!

Hard requirement: At this time we are only considering candidates who can work in the U.S. without sponsorship and can fit their workday into the 8am-7pm ET range. We are open to international candidates working in similar time zones, so long as your country's laws permit you to work for a U.S. based company on a contract basis.

The Job - Full Stack Web Developer
Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (usually PostgreSQL). In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React/Vue, HTML, and CSS/SASS. There's also opportunities for you to be involved in devops work if interested.
This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.
While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.
Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks, months, or occasionally years.
Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.

Management
Your immediate manager will be a 'Team Lead.' This is a senior developer, project manager, and team captain all rolled into one. It's also someone whose proven to be talented with both code and people, especially communication. We don't believe non-technical managers bring a lot of value to a development team, so we don't use them. Ditto non-technical project managers. We keep our dev teams small and they usually have a small number of projects so that our team leads don't get overwhelmed. Communication with clients usually involves the team lead and the developers working on the project. We try to avoid the 'phone game' whenever possible.
The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and 'drive' a project to completion is essential. Your team lead will be a ready and willing resource to help you architect solutions and/or solve problems, but won't micro-manage. If you aren't asking them for help or indicating you have a problem, they will assume you are making good progress on the issues assigned to you during sprint planning, which happens every two weeks.
Our CEO/CED and CTO are both software engineers and heavily involved in the engineering operations of the company. They oversee the health of the development team and projects, help our sales team evaluate opportunities for technical and capacity fit, gather feedback from the devs on what is and isn't working in our tech stack and/or processes, and consider the value that emerging technologies might bring to our organization.

Sustainability
'Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely' (Agile Manifesto principle).
We actively manage every part of our organization through the lens of what is reasonably sustainable. For example, it's why we:
Keep our dev teams relatively small
Emphasize a 40 hour work week
Are candid with our clients and set realistic expectations for them

Are relatively slow adopters of new technologies (so we can see if there is actual value there...not just hype and thereby avoid needless churn)
Promote professionalism, mitigate drama, and cultivate reasonable relationships with each other
Regularly seek input from the team on what isn't working for them or where improvements can be made
We don't want anyone to burn out. We'd prefer our team to be here and fully engaged for years to come.
Senior DeveloperThe position we have open is for a Senior Developer.  Senior Developers usually have 6-10+ years relevant experience and meet the following requirements:
Technical Skills
Are able to write modular, well-tested, and maintainable code
Know at least two software development domains (SQL, Front-End, Back-End) really well and are capable of radiating that knowledge to our team and beyond
Are able to work on multiple projects as needed


Leadership
Leads the design for customer projects with feedback from other engineers
Proposes new ideas for improving the development team, customer projects, and/or our tech stack
Adheres to and promotes our development culture and mission

For Team Leads (see below): invests in other team members to see that they are growing as individuals and to facilitate productivity within our team.


Code quality
Leaves code in substantially better shape than before
Fixes bugs/regressions quickly
Monitors overall code quality/build failures
Creates tests religiously and makes sure the rest of the team is doing the same
Proactively identifies and reduces technical debt
Proactively defines and solves important architectural issues that may hinder development


Communication
Provides thorough and timely code feedback for peers
Able to communicate clearly on technical topics
Keeps issues up-to-date with progress
Helps guide other merge requests to completion
Helps with recruiting and interviewing
Is able to manage conversations directly with customer contacts when needed.


Performance & Scalability
Excellent at writing production-ready code with little assistance
Able to write complex code that can scale with a significant number of users
Avoids premature optimization



Leadership
In addition to the leadership expectations noted above, some of our senior developers will also be involved in leading other developers and interacting with customers. We realize not every senior developer is as good with people as they are with code and that's ok. We need and value individual contributors. But if you like and are good at interacting with people, we will have opportunities for you to lead teams and/or projects.
Everything Else
General Requirements

6+ years developing database-driven web applications with PythonIf you only have 2-3 years of Python experience, we may still consider your application, but we will need to see experience with other dynamic languages: Ruby, PHP, JavaScript/Node; MVC (ish) web architecture; and strong experience/skills in two of the following: SQL, modern front-end JavaScript (React preferred), or automated testing (TDD a plus).

You agree with and would be pleased to work under our development mission statement and guiding principles

We Are Offering
Salary: We are targeting $115K-$145K but would consider stretching for the right candidate.
We'll talk about salary & benefits in our first Zoom interview to make sure we are mutually in the compensation ballpark.
Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.


Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, we payout profit sharing bonuses twice a year.
One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.
We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.
We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.


PTO/Vacation (5+ weeks total):
Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year
5-12 sick days per year
9 holidays


Healthcare:
We provide Health Insurance through an Anthem Silver Blue Access PPO
We cover 100% of the premium for employees and 50% for dependents
The plan has a broad nationwide network which should give all our employees, regardless of where they live, plenty of options for in-network providers
The PPO is matched with an Health Savings Account (HSA) and we match employee contributions to the HSA
We unfortunately cannot offer some benefits such as healthcare to international candidates.


Flexibility:
While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours (fitting in the window of 8-7 ET), we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.
It's not uncommon for our employees to take time off during the week and make it up during the evening or weekend so as to avoid needing to use PTO.


Telecommuting/Remote:
We all work remotely, and have for years.
That means our tools (Slack, Zoom, GitHub, etc.) and planning are designed to work for a distributed team.
We are open to international candidates working in similar time zones, so long as your country's laws permit you to work for a U.S. based company on a contract basis.


We Care: It's easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.
The Company - Level 12Who Are We?Level 12 is development firm that specializes in building custom software for our customers. We manage the entire process including planning, managing, and building software exactly as the customer needs it.
We serve customers in diverse industries including: non-profit, automotive, manufacturing, logistics, and financial. Our customers range in size from small startups to Fortune 500.
We set ourselves apart by digging into the customer's problem until we can own it and then delivering highly functional software that brings significant value to the customer's organization. That may not sound unique, but the longer we do this, the more we encounter people who have been burned by bad development experiences with other firms. We look for long-term relationships with our customers and have some that go back to 2005.
We may not be changing the world, but we are impacting the lives of our customers and their employees. You don't have to take our word for it, checkout some of our reviews by our customers.
This is a video we often use with our prospective customers to explain our agile/iterative development process (< 2 mins):
On Development Best PracticesBehind the scenes, we are using software development best practices to ensure that the code we deliver is flexible, maintainable, and works well for the user for years to come.
We know what it's like to work in a substandard development environment or culture that accepts or maybe even promotes practices that kill developer productivity and enjoyment. We work hard at promoting development best practices and ingraining them into our culture. If you come work for us, you can look forward to:

All projects managed in a Git
Development workflow using GitHub for pull requests, issue management, code coverage (using CodeCov), CI integration (using CircleCi), etc.
Developer friendly project setup: all our projects can be run locally on a developer's machine.
Test-centric development methodology:
Asking 'how can we test this' is ingrained into our engineering and development workflow.
We have Continuous Integration (CI) running for all of our projects for at least the backend code (Python mostly) and some of the projects also run the JavaScript tests in CI.


A focus on Agile Principles while not being enslaved to them.
A openness to changing our processes and using new technologies when those changes add value to Level 12 and/or our customers.
If you'd like to learn more about what makes us tick, our Chief Executive Developer (CED) gave a talk on the importance of CI and automation in an agile software development process (embedded video) and has given other talks and presentations on various topics.
Character First
Level 12 was founded on biblical principles and has biblically informed Values. See the about page for our Mission, Values, Vision, and Purpose statements.
Due to differing or a lack of religious convictions, we respect that employees may not be able to identify with our faith-based Vision and Purpose. Applicants are not asked questions regarding nor expected to discuss their religious beliefs during the application process or during employment. But, we do expect all applicants and employees to share our Values.
Our Values describe not only who we are as an organization, but also who we are not. They encompass our ethics, principles, and beliefs about our organization and its relationship to the world. They communicate to employees the behaviors that are approved (and rewarded), and by extension those that are not.

Integrity: We are honest, trustworthy, reliable, and ethical. We act the same, regardless of who is watching, and especially when no-one is watching. If you use pirated software or media, don't mind 'tweaking' the truth, or think porn == entertainment, this is not the job for you!

Work ethic: We work hard and like to work hard. We also work smart.  We want to do in 40 hours a week what other people need 50+ hours to do.

Work/life balance: All work and no play is a lose-lose situation. We work hard during work hours but are committed to protecting our schedules and ensuring adequate time for rest and family responsibilities.

Flexibility: Life happens and rarely on schedule or according to plan. Flexibility keeps us from snapping during the storms of life. When things change, we need to be able to role with the punches.

Dedication: We desire to contribute and to create value for our clients and the company. We demonstrate a high level of “ownership” for and initiative with projects assigned to us.

Teachable: We are open to and desire feedback/correction. We are willing to ask for help even if it makes us “look bad.”

Kaizen, continuous improvement: We recognize the value of continually striving to improve ourselves and the processes around us.

Resourceful: We like problem solving and seek to use all resources at our disposal in an efficient manner to troubleshoot. We know when to ask someone for help and when more effort is needed on our part.

Gifting / Core Competency: People are often gifted in ways that make them very good at doing some things and not very good at doing others. Our employees and our company needs to be operating in areas we are strongest in, i.e. focusing on our core competencies.

Attention to detail: Grand visions, out of necessity, are often presented in abbreviated form, but making grand visions a reality requires lots of detail.

Professional: We take our work seriously, striving for competence in everything we do and excellence in as many things as possible.

Humility: We often take ourselves too seriously. We are a stunning mix of great potential and great weakness. We will have the greatest success when we acknowledge both.

Finitude: We are finite beings, more limited than we often want to admit. But great strength comes from knowing and admitting where you are weak and compensating for it.

Balance: Most of life requires trade-offs, we can not be excellent in everything we do.

Patience & Longevity: We often overestimate what we can do in five years and underestimate what we can do in 20.

Generosity: It is better to give than to receive.
Next Step - Ready To Apply?Have Questions?
Despite the length of this post, we may have missed something. If you have a question that the job description didn't answer, and you would like it answered before applying, please email us: [email protected]. We usually respond the same or next business day.

If you don't hear anything back from us, double check whether you followed the instructions above (🙂) and then email us for a status update.

To: [email protected]

Subject: Web Developer Application
Body:
Include a bit about yourself. We hire humans, not robots. 🙂
Include answers to the 'Application Questions' below.


Attach: resume, preferably in PDF
Don't fret about your resume content or formatting. We are looking almost exclusively for relevant work history.
We will send out a questionnaire for more info, so no need for you to guess at what we want to know.



No cookie-cutter cover letters please!
You should hear back from us in a week or so. You are welcome to email us to check on the status of your application: [email protected]

Application Questions
Any feedback on the job description? Too long? Too short? Find a typo? No...that's ok too. This isn't a test. :)
Based on your experience, how do you grade a developer? That is, what makes the difference between a mediocre developer (1 of 5) and stellar developer (5 of 5). Where do you fit in?
What excites you about programming? What discourages you?
What makes a company's culture enjoyable to you? Not enjoyable?
Based on this job description what do you find most attractive about this position? What do you find less attractive?
Based on our company website and anything else you may know about us, what most attracts you to our company? What concerns you?
Where did you originally find this job posting?
Where do you live (city/state)? Do you have a comfortable, distraction-free environment setup for remote work?
Are you a US citizen or otherwise eligible to work in the United States without sponsorship? Note: as stated above, US Citizenship or ability to work in the US without sponsorship is a hard requirement as is a willingness to work generally between 8am - 7pm Eastern.
Are you potentially interested in a 30-90 day contract-to-hire position?
We typically evaluate candidates to join our team as full-time W2 employees.
However, if your current job situation is such that you'd be interested in working full-time (or close to FT) for 30-90 days while we got to know you better and vice-versa, please answer in the affirmative.  It's not a guarantee we'd offer or even consider you for this arrangement, just good to know for those who are interested.
Answering 'no' to this question will not have any adverse effect on your application.



Regarding Authenticity: as you answer these questions, please keep in mind that we prefer candor over flattery and we are under no delusion that this is the perfect position or we are the perfect company. Likewise, we don't believe there are any perfect candidates. We understand that companies and people are made up of both strengths and weaknesses and the better we understand both your strengths and weaknesses the more likely we are to make a wise hiring decision.
Please take time to answer the questions thoughtfully and accurately.
Check your SPAM!!!
If you don't hear from us, check your SPAM folder. All emails that we send will come from the domain 'level12.io'.

The Rest of the Process
Our application process is outlined roughly below.
But, before you get there, we want to apologize in advance if this process seems...imposing.  We have put considerable thought and refinement into each one of these steps in an effort to make sure our hiring process is as well crafted as our software.  And just like software, hiring is a lot more complex than it might seem on the surface.  Our hiring process is far from perfect (like our software), we are still learning and tweaking, but we want to assure you that each of these steps gives us crucial information regarding you and your development abilities that is essential for helping us to determine if this is a good match.
Consider this: our entire process is less than a week's worth of effort to make sure that where you spend the next 1-5 years of your life is a good fit.  Isn't that worth it?  Keep in mind that we have deliberately structured our process so that the earlier stages require less effort.  Our hope is that if you make it to the later stages of our process, where the time commitment increases, you will have had a chance to get to know us a bit better so you can decide if the time investment on your part is worth it.  We care about your time (and ours) and do our best not to waste it!

HourStack helps teams of all sizes with a holistic, visual approach to both time tracking and scheduling — easily connect favorite applications with zero disruption to workflow or use HourStack on its own. The all-in-one visual calendar helps you see, plan, and track your team's time across tasks and projects in a complete view. Easily schedule tasks, accurately track time, pull actionable reports, and customize your workspace and permissions.
The current team
Based in Seattle, we’re a purposely lean yet diverse group of people with backgrounds in software development, marketing, design, and everything in between. What brings us together is our passion for technology and customer-driven innovation. We share a vision to make work fun and easy and we respect every one of our users and employees as we all work together to create the most simple, flexible time management tool available.Over half the team is in Seattle, but we are fully remote and work mostly asynchronously with a strong written culture. We optimize for deep work and have no standing meetings for the product team. We believe in simplicity, trust, autonomy, innovation, and enjoying work.We are building a great product with an incredible team and we are bootstrapping the business, which allows us to do this on our terms and at our pace.
Your role with us
HourStack's RESTful API is in a great spot. Over the last 18 months we've rebuilt it from scratch with our current and future architecture in mind — the ultimate goal of it being pleasant and fast to develop on HourStack for our team and third-party developers.As a small team, we all have our areas of focus and ownership, but contribute to many aspects of the business to ensure product and marketing are fully synced. From designing, building, and testing, to documenting, hosting, and supporting, you will own the API as your primary responsibility.This is a backend heavy fullstack engineering role, but you will have some secondary responsibilities such as technical support for the marketing team, internal tooling, and browser extensions where you'll need solid frontend experience.Here are some of the projects we have lined up for your first year. We'll be focusing on a mix of improving the core of HourStack as well as extending HourStack with a number of new integrations.


Budgeting: money and time, fixed or recurring, for clients and projects.

Availability: workspace-wide days off, individual time off, availability history, etc. to get 100% accuracy on member availability for scheduling and reporting.

Reporting: expansion of reports offered including customizable dashboards

Task integrations: Jira, Basecamp, ClickUp, Wrike, Monday.com, etc.

Invoicing/Payroll integrations: Quickbooks, Xero, Freshbooks, Gusto, etc.

Support integrations: HubSpot, Intercom, HelpScout, Zen Desk, etc.

Launch API: for third-parties and marketplace for apps that extend HourStack's functionality.

Affiliate program: to earn payouts for referring customers.

Referral program: for customers to earn rewards when their friends sign up.

Browser extension: to allow creating timers anywhere on the web and running timers from within the UI of other applications.

Technologies we use

Our API is built on a LEMP stack hosted with DigitalOcean. Our framework of choice is Laravel and we utilize many tools from that ecosystem, such as Forge for server management, Envoyer for zero downtime deployments, Cashier for managing subscriptions with Stripe, Passport for OAuth, Horizon for queue management, etc.Our web client utilizes React, TypeScript, Next.js, etc., but our marketing site and admin utilize a Vue.js setup. We are planning on using React for the browser extensions as well, but we'd want to get your feedback on that choice. You'll need familiarity with standard testing and development tools and technologies such as Git, Yarn, Babel, PHPUnit, etc.For collaboration we use Notion, Slack, Google Meet, and sometimes email.
Qualifications and experience you need


Extensive experience developing performant and reliable APIs with Laravel that have had real-world utilization (a must). We love to learn on the job, but we are expecting a high level of initial knowledge and skill so that you can hit the ground running.

Experience building real frontend applications with the technology we use, though we would be happy if you're more biased to backend work as that aligns with this role. We have an incredible UI/UX designer that will provide fully complete designs, including prototypes in Figma, so you don't need strong design skills to be successful with this position. Though a good eye never hurt!

DevOps experience is also required. You won't be solely responsible for infrastructure, but you will be a part of helping scale and maintain it as we grow until we are in a position to hire a specialist. We do use some managed and semi-managed services to keep the burden fairly low and would be very happy if you have strong experience here as well.

You must love to be productive! We are building a productivity product here, but you will also be working with a small, dedicated, and focused team that knows how to crank out very high-quality work. We all enjoy having significant amounts of uninterrupted work time to maximize our productivity.

You'll also need to have experience working remotely and the skills that come along with that such as excellent written and verbal communication, self-motivation, flexibility, reliability, etc.

Why you'll love working with us


Fun, ambitious, bright coworkers. We genuinely like working together, learning from each other, and brainstorming ways to make our product and customer experience even better.

Company culture and product. You'll join a company that has a solid vision, very open communication, and a product roadmap that continually delivers.

Plenty of growth opportunities. This is an early-stage company, which means there will be plenty of opportunities to grow as the company matures.

Competitive compensation. Salary for this full-time position is expected to be between $85-$125,000 depending on experience, location, etc.


Note: We do prefer US-based employees for the time being as it is more simple to manage at our stage. We have employees in WA, CA, and KY currently.

Benefits include:


We utilize an ICHRA, which is a type of HRA that provides you with tax-free reimbursements for individual health insurance premiums and other health, dental, and vision expenses. This allows you to select the perfect insurance for your family rather than us having to chose a one-size-fits-none plan for the company.

401(k) through Vanguard/Ascensus. We match your contributions dollar-for-dollar up to 4% of your salary. You can also make Roth contributions and the plan allows for in-service distributions. You are always 100% vested in the money contributed.

We offer flexibility to take time off as needed for vacation, personal, or sick days as long as you are completing your work and you schedule/plan with the team ahead of time when possible to ensure your absence doesn't negatively impact them.

What are the next steps?
If this role sounds perfect for you, send your resume to [email protected]. We look forward to reviewing it! We have a simple process and if we'd like to move forward with you, here are what the steps look like:

You'll next have an interview with the technical owner of HourStack. This will be a general discussion to talk about your experience, the role, the business, upcoming projects, etc.
We'll setup a simple test project in a GitHub repo that you can clone. We'll explain where the project is at and where we want you to take it. This will help ensure you've got the core skills we need. If you are qualified for the role, this will be very easy for you. We want you to spend less than two hours on this. Alternatively, if you have a recent project that will demonstrate skills sufficient to qualify for this role, we'd be happy to have you walk us through that project, explain the code you've written, etc.
From there we'd have a final interview with the product team to cover any last questions from both sides and to ensure we all mesh well together and are excited to work together.
We'll extend an offer and we are ready to have you start immediately.", "USA-ONLY", "N/A", "Dec 30", "🇺🇸 USA-ONLY

We’re looking for motivated, creative, and resourceful developers who take pride in their work and want to partner with clients who are pushing the boundaries of the technology we work with.
Software Developers at Alley work collaboratively to understand the challenges facing our clients and implement effective and meaningful technological solutions, frequently using WordPress.  Your responsibilities will range from technical discovery that informs custom feature builds to custom architecture and development to large-scale data migrations for a high volume of content.
Software Developers at Alley need to be well-rounded technologists who have a holistic understanding of the web technology stacks that we work with, are excited about keeping our team at the cutting edge, and are eager to work directly with clients to help them solve interesting and novel business problems.

Qualifications

Our primary development language is PHP. You must be fully fluent in PHP and have worked with it in a professional context before.
Prior experience with WordPress and/or Laravel is a major plus. If you haven’t worked with either, you should be excited to learn and develop with them.
We make heavy use of ES Next JavaScript (particularly React, as well as Node) and related tooling, including webpack. Previous experience is a plus, and a willingness to learn it is essential.
Alley prides itself on its ability to address unusual, novel, and complex problems that deal with the intersection of technology, business, and content production. You should understand and be able to discuss web technologies and systems conceptually, and be able to demonstrate that you can learn a new language, technology stack, or framework quickly and on demand.
You should feel comfortable at a Unix command line, even if you aren’t an expert.
You must know your way around git and understand version control well, and be able to carry out typical operations with it, including branching, merging, submitting code for peer review, and reviewing your peers’ code yourself.
We apply Scrum as a development methodology, and broadly endorse Agile as a philosophy. You must be open to working this way as well, and prior experience is a plus.
You should also have very strong written and verbal communication skills, and the ability to wield them with both team members and clients. 
Discipline concerning delivery dates, stylistic appreciation of what makes code good and readable, and a committed attitude about documentation, user stories, issue tracking, and timesheets are all very important skills for our developers to have.

We offer competitive salaries and company subsidized medical, dental and vision benefits. We also offer a 401(k) with company matching, a profit sharing plan, and a monthly lunch allowance.
We have no set hours and do not limit vacation or sick time. We trust our team members to get their work done and take the time off they need to recharge, and we suggest an average of three weeks off per year.
We are a fully distributed company, meaning we don’t have a set work location. Team members can choose to work from home or from a co-working space. We’ll furnish your home office or rent you a co-working space.

ResponsibilitiesYou are going to help us build a world-class SaaS-platform from the ground up, that allows landlords to navigate from their computer screen legal risks and valuation implications buried inside contract language, in a way the market never thought possible. You will be working with our team of distinguished real estate lawyers, creative software developers and architects, PMs and UX designers, to deliver a world-class product that will revolutionize the commercial real estate industry.


RequirementsThe most important characteristic we're after is that you are a technologist – or however you self-identify your passion for developing and building technology that provides real commercial results – and are keen on participating in a pleasant and high functioning team.

You don't have to know everything, but you do have to have the potential to learn anything quickly and you should know a lot about of the following disciplines:


Cloud native development and deployment - You have built, run and delivered software either on cloud environments or for cloud environments using modern methods and can talk about the considerations that go into the design. Deploying with Docker and AWS or similar makes you feel right at home. 

Full-stack development with excellent knowledge of backend technologies - You are comfortable developing for the frontend and but have a leaning towards the backend.

Knowledge of databases - You are equally comfortable with noSQL and SQL databases and can conceptualize solutions in either, weighing advantages and disadvantages depending on use-case. 

Modern Programming Languages like Java, Python, Javascript/nodeJS and a frontend framework (Vue.JS or React.JS) - You can build software irrespective of language. You understand how to turn a post-it note into outcomes and have a good track record of supporting your software from inception through to upgrade.

Ultimately, you'll be excited about being at the inception of a high-performance environment, and you'll enjoy being pushed technically and organizationally to do things 'the right way' as part of the core team that is building a world-class product.Ideally you would be based in Hong Kong, but we are also interested in getting to know you if you are within +/- 3 hours of the Hong Kong time zone.

So, if you are someone who…

enjoys UX / user-centric design and product delivery,
is pragmatic and commercial, but never settles for mediocrity,
values flexibility, but wants to have ownership of your tasks,
gains satisfaction from solving puzzles and logic problems,
likes communicating what you've discovered to your colleagues and customers in plain English, rather than encrypted acronyms,
would enjoy a paid 2-week bonus Christmas break upon successful product launch and client acquisition, and
is excited about building a product that marries ease of use with expert features to re-invent an ancient market,

… we think you should get in touch, because you would be a great addition to our team!", "ASIA-ONLY", "N/A", "Dec 30", "ASIA-ONLY
